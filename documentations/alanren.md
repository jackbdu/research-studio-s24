# Enhance the ml5.js website with built-in code editor

## [Project Proposal](../projects/alanren.md)

## Interview & Research

At ITP and IMA, nearly all students had been exposed to p5.js (and used p5 web editor), while many were introduced to ml5.js as part of their coursework. However, the ml5.js website itself provides relatively less information for reference. During my interviews with peers and non-ITP/IMA students (a total of 18):

- More than 80% of the students agreed that they would be more motivated to learn if they could see the results of the code first.
- More than 85% of students agree that a good reference page can help them learn independently.
